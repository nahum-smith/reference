# Virtualbox Setup and Notes

Virtualbox is a cross platform virtualization application, that installs on your existing operating system regardless of which system you are running.  

Some Terminology:  
* Host operating system (host OS) - This is the operating system of the physical computer you are running.
* Guest operating system (guest OS) - This is the operating system running inside of the virtual machine.   
* Virtual machine (VM) - This is the special environment that virtualbox creates for your guest operating system while it is running.  You run your guest OS 'in' your VM.
* Guest additions - this refers to special software packages which are shipped with VirtualBox but designed to be installed *inside* a VM to improve performance of the guest OS and to add extra features.
